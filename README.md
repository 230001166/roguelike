# roguelike

A simple text-based roguelike, with a twist.

You can only have three skills, and every time you beat an enemy, you have to replace one of your skills with theirs.

If you beat a Vampire, you can leech enemies' health. But if you fight an enemy that does nothing, you could have to give up a good skill.
